This is a sample showing how to access WPS from an external Rexx script.
Run the install script and then run 'access.cmd' script file.  The access
script file shows the list of desktop objects (handle and title).

The install script installs an MNRexx object that acts as an agent to
access WPS.

The access script first pushes the commands to be executed to a queue
named 'test', then causes 'SETUP' event by sending the name of the
queue.

The agent object, on the 'SETUP' event, pulls the commands from the
queue and executes it (using 'interpret' builtin keyword function).
As a result of the execution of the queued command, the handle and
the title of the desktop objects are queued to the queue.

The access script then pulls the results from the queue.
