This is a sample demonstrating how to change a dropped object's style.

The script does the following:

    for each dropped object,

        - sets the object deletable if not (i.e., if OBJECT_NODELETE style
        is set;

        - delete the object with confirmation

        - if the user cancels the delete operation, resets the style flag
        to the original
